# React Todo App

This is a simple todo app built using ReactJS, Vite JS, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of this app is to allow users to create a list of tasks they need to complete and mark them as completed when finished.

## Installation

To get started with this app, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.
Run the command `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Usage

Once the development server is up and running, you can access the app by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can start adding new tasks to your todo list by typing them into the input field at the top of the page and pressing the `Add Task` button.

To mark a task as completed, simply click the checkbox next to the task name. This will strike through the task name to indicate that it has been completed. If you wish to remove a task from the list, click the `Delete` button next to the task name.

## Customization

This app is designed to be customizable, so if you wish to change the styling or functionality of the app, you can do so by modifying the HTML, CSS, and ReactJS code.
